A web scraper for getting all of the RIck and Morty Transcripts from Rickipedia.

## Usage

To download the transcripts to a specific path

```console
> python observer.py --path data
```

this will download the transcripts into the data directory

each season has its own subdirectory, and each episode is its own .txt file.

For example, the Pickle Rick episode would be downloaded to path/03/03.txt.
